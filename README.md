#  Godot-Vampire-Survivors-Tutorial
I followed GDQuest's [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwCiGixlqiU).
I finished the tutorial, and the first commit is pretty much just following the tutorial exactly.

Subsequent commits will be additional features added on to the tutorial. Some ideas are
* Increase damage of enemies depending on time and enemies killed.
* Add additional enemies
* Import some of my [pixel art](https://github.com/kwilson33/Pixel-Art), and get them animated in the game.
* Add a powerup.
* Add a second level.

## Completed tasks
* Tutorial completed on 2/7/24
* Counter + label added for enemies killed 2/10/24
